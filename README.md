# Basic-Pentesting-1
This repository contains a unique approach for penetrating into the Basic Pentesting 1 box on vulnhub. Different and unique. This method does not gain access to the meterpreter or shell of the target system. Instead, uses the web for simple and easy approach to gain access to the system.

A document will be attached to this repository and I hope that beginners will find this simple and easy. Also it will give them a way to break the stereotype of gaining the shellmeterpreter to do everything.
